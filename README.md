# carbon-clickhouse
Graphite metrics receiver with ClickHouse as storage

## Production status
Last releases are stable and ready for production use

## TL;DR
[Preconfigured docker-compose](https://github.com/lomik/graphite-clickhouse-tldr)

## Build
```sh
# build binary
git clone https://github.com/lomik/carbon-clickhouse.git
cd carbon-clickhouse
make
```

## ClickHouse configuration

1. Add `graphite_rollup` section to config.xml. Sample [here](https://github.com/lomik/graphite-clickhouse-tldr/blob/master/rollup.xml). You can use [carbon-schema-to-clickhouse](https://github.com/bzed/carbon-schema-to-clickhouse) for generate rollup xml from graphite [storage-schemas.conf](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-schemas-conf).

2. Create tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE graphite ( 
  Path String,  
  Value Float64,  
  Time UInt32,  
  Date Date,  
  Timestamp UInt32
) ENGINE = GraphiteMergeTree('graphite_rollup')
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(Date)
ORDER BY (Path, Time);

-- optional table for faster metric search
CREATE TABLE graphite_index (
  Date Date,
  Level UInt32,
  Path String,
  Version UInt32
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(Version)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(Date)
ORDER BY (Level, Path, Date);

-- optional table for storing Graphite tags
CREATE TABLE graphite_tagged (
  Date Date,
  Tag1 String,
  Path String,
  Tags Array(String),
  Version UInt32
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(Version)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(Date)
ORDER BY (Tag1, Path, Date);
```

[GraphiteMergeTree documentation](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/graphitemergetree/)

You can create Replicated tables. See [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replication/)
